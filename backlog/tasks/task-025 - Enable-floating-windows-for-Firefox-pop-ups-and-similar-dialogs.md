## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Configure Hyprland to handle Firefox pop-ups as floating windows instead of tiling them. This may require exploring how Hyprland detects and handles pop-up style windows more broadly, not just for Firefox. Research window rules and criteria for identifying pop-up dialogs, modal windows, and similar UI elements that should float by default.
