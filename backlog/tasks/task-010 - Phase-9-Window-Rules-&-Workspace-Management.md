<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implementation completed: Added windowrulev2 configuration with comprehensive window rules for common applications (Firefox, Ghostty, Discord, Steam, OBS). Configured workspace groupings by use case: ws1=Firefox, ws2=Terminals, ws3=Discord, ws4=Steam, ws5=OBS. Set default layouts and workspace-monitor assignments. Added floating/tiling rules for applications, opacity settings for visual consistency, and sticky window behavior for PiP. Configuration tested and builds successfully without errors.
